# odin-rock-paper-scissors

I am unsure as to how well I've done on this project. I was able to create a good Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played on the browser console fairly well, even accounting for odd inputs from the user, however I can't tell if I followed best practices as recommended earlier in the course - I just can't remmeber most of them. 

I will have to try find high-quality examples of other people's work and find commonalities among them. 

I also do not feel confident in my understanding of the use of function parameters, and I did not make use of any in the project, even though one of the steps told me to. I will need to revise that topic and possibly return to this project later and try to incorporate their use as practise.
